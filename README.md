# Python Desktop App

Learn how to make a desktop GUI application using Python, JavaScript, HTML, & CSS all thanks to [pywebview](https://pywebview.flowrl.com/).

[pywebview](https://pywebview.flowrl.com/) is essentially a mini web-browser that you can control. It makes it really easy to write any python code to integrate directly to JavaScript. Building an app for pywebview is much like building a web application but a few key differences:

- Database optional
- Access to local users' file system
- Virtually no latency (between JavaScript and Python)
- Offline by default (no need to use the internet).

The advantage of using pywebview is that:

- Frontends can leverage web technology frontends like React, Vue, Angular, Bootstrap, Preact, and much more
- Incredibly small build size (roughly 20MB for a full application)
- Simple and powerful API
- Cross Platform (macOS, Windows, Linux)

> Code updated to work with Python 3.10 and other latest software versions.
